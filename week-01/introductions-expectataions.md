## Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp: let's break it down

    - Question: What does it mean to be a developer?
    - A person who writes applications in computer code.
    - This is you!  Right now!  You belong here.
    - Attributes
        - Tenacity
        - Teamwork
        - Empathy
    - Developer is not the only career path coming out of this bootcamp, just the most common
        - project manager
        - technical recruiter
        - designer
        - UI/UX specialist
        - business analyst

    - Question: Which devices run browsers?
        - Laptops/desktops

          -Tablets
        - Screen readers
        - Cars
        - APIs
        - More
- Fullstack - Facile with both front-end and back-end development

    - **front-end** - how the page looks and behaves
        - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related technologies
        - Not the same as a designer!
    - **back-end** - transforming data between human-readable and machine-readable formats
        - **Database** - where our data is stored
        - back-end language (PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, many others)
- Bootcamp - 10 week intensive course
    - Expect homework
        - Almost 2/3 of our students report doing more than 10 hours per week outside of class.
        - Last three weeks are especially intense
    - We treat this like a professional environment, not a classroom
        - Accountability: first you, then peers, then instructors.
        - No personal attacks, rudeness, mocking, condescension, or other toxic interpersonal behavior.
    - Bring your whole self
        - Mental, emotional, and physical.
        - Transparency!  If we know what's going on, we can help.
        - Attendance and participation is mandatory - 50% of capstone

## Classroom logistics
- Some terms we sometimes use
    - **clam shells down**: close laptops/ lower monitors.
    - **TL;DR**: too long; didn't read.
    - **re-hi all**: Class is starting again.
- Zoom intro
    - breakout rooms
    - chat
    - we don't usually pay attention to nonverbal responses
        - don't use "raise hand", speak up instead
- Stand-up meetings: 15 minute meetings 8:00 a.m.
    - What you did (including tech work/events outside of class)
    - What you're going to do next
- Snap challenges
    - short one-hour assignments designed to use and build beyond what you learned
    - not like regular quizzes -- you aren't always going to get the answer!
    - really good analog to what you often do as a professional developer
